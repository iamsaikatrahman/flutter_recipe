# Flutter Recipe

It is a Recipe app. In this app, I collect all data from the free API "TheMealDB". Here users can see the random recipes. Users can show various categories and countries recipes. Users can search for any recipe. For searching, users can use cool filter features. These filter features help the user easily find what he/she wants. Users can see full details about recipes ingredients, instructions, and also youtube videos. I follow the MVC pattern for writing code for this Recipe app. I use flutter cool scrolling features that why when users scroll down they can show a floating action button that actually helps to jump bottom to top. 

## Screens:

1. Splash Screen
2. Onboarding Screen
3. Home Scree
4. Search Screen
5. Show Search Filter Option
6. Recipe Details Screen
